# DiceRollPlay
# Basic Javascript Project
Project Overview:
The Dice Roller application will simulate rolling two six-sided dice. 
Each time the user clicks a button, the application will generate a random number between 1 and 6 for each die, 
display the results, and determine whether the sum of the numbers exceeds 8. 
If the sum exceeds 8, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses. 
Additionally, the application will allow users to save the roll history to a list.

Tasks:
1.Set up the HTML structure to display the dice roll results and roll history.
2.Implement JavaScript functions to generate random numbers for two dice rolls.
3.Display the dice roll results on the page.
4.Determine the outcome based on the sum of the numbers rolled.
5.Allow users to save the roll history to a list.
6.Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing.
